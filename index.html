            “Trinkkultur”: <br>
            a german word wich literally translates to “drinking culture”. 
            It is linked to the folkloristic habit of drinking, often referring 
            to something alcoholic as part 
            of a social process.

            The consumption of alcohol among young people in recent years 
            is increasingly turning into a real abuse, defined as binge-drinking: drinking with only purpose to get drunk.

            <div class="crash-pic flex-display-center-center">

            </div>

            The heavy consequences involve exposition to direct medical/health effects, where the consumption of alcohol in 
            young people causes a <span class="data">4x higher risk of developing an addiction</span> in adulthood. In addition to this, it is estimated 
            that more than <span class="data">25% of accidents</span> for young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are attributable to alcohol.

            Teenagers regularly consume alcoholic beverages, among which beer stands out, followed by wine and lastly liquors. 
            These attitudes, still partially linked to the present cultural heritage, are however embracing a very risky drift, 
            that is no longer linked to the rituality of meals and conviviality, but rather one, that is, as Barnao defines, 
            connected to a social desire of  adolescents to integrate within the group and to feel more uninhibited. <br>
